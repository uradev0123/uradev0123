ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rintaro Ura from Japan, and used to live overseas for a long time, around 9 years in total, having many experiences on Web Development and translating English to Japanese, and also the opposite.

ãƒ»Experiences in the JavaScript, React, PHP Development
While primarily focusing on frontend development, I am also participating in backend development using PHP.

ãƒ»Experiences upon translating formal and informal language
I may need communication upon what the writing infers to be 100% accurate, so lets keep in touch.
